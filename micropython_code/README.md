# FireworkController Micropython Code
**This Code was tested on a _WIFI LoRa 32 V2_.**

## Requirements
There are no special requirements (you have to install micropython on your microcontroller), but the Code uses a modified version of my [micropython-nextion](https://github.com/programmer372/micropython-nextion) library.
